# Implementation Plan TODO

This file tracks active work items. Keep entries short and verifiable.

## Now

- [ ] Stabilize build and setup scripts.
- [ ] Keep Unity plugin sync reliable.
- [ ] Maintain deterministic tick ordering across subsystems.
- [ ] ALP: Deterministic IR + TCS34725 device bridge.

## Next

- [ ] Expand regression coverage for physics and firmware.
- [ ] Improve QEMU guest lifecycle handling.
- [ ] Document supported board profiles.
- [ ] Realistic mechanics: DC motor + gearbox + wheel traction.
- [ ] Realistic mechanics: servo PWM + torque-limited actuation.
- [ ] Power integrity: droop + brownout/reset behavior.

## Later

- [ ] Expand device graph bindings in Unity.
- [ ] Add fixtures for thermal and environment models.
- [ ] ALP golden-trace fixtures (motors/servos/sensors).
