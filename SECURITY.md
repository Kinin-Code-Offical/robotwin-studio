## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you found a security issue:

1. Do **not** open a public issue with exploit details.
2. Prefer GitHub Security Advisories ("Report a vulnerability") if enabled for this repository.
3. If advisories are not enabled, open an issue with minimal details and request a private channel.

We’ll acknowledge receipt and work with you on a coordinated fix.
