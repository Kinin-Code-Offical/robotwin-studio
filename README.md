# RoboTwin Studio (Windows)

A powerful, General Arduino + Robotics Simulator Platform designed for Windows.

## Overview
RoboTwin Studio empowers users to build and test Arduino circuits, firmware, and complex robots within a high-fidelity Unity-based physics environment.

## Key Features
- **Project Wizard**: Quick start with templates for Circuits, Mechatronics, and Robotics.
- **Circuit Studio**: Drag-and-drop circuit builder with behavioral validation.
- **Firmware Lab**: Virtual Arduino runtime with waveform injection and telemetry.
- **Robot Studio**: Compose robots from a catalog of mechanical parts.
- **World Studio**: Design interactive tracks and environments.

## Repository Structure
- `/CoreSim`: Pure C# simulation core (deterministic, no Unity dependencies).
- `/UnityApp`: Unity-based visualization and UI layer.
- `/docs`: Technical documentation and architecture.

## Getting Started
See [DEV_SETUP_WINDOWS.md](docs/DEV_SETUP_WINDOWS.md) for environment configuration.
